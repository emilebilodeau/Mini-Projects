# Description of mini-projects

## Project I - API
This project involved using get requests to retrieve and parse json files from the London API. Most of the project involved retrieving specific information, such as how many different modes of transportation are available, how many bikepoints are there in London, etc. 

Tools used:
* Python

## Project II - Data Wrangling
This project also involved making get requests, this time for the yelp and foursquare APIs. The goal was to create a small database containing information about points of interest (POI) and using either SQL or pandas to make queries. I chose to use to yelp API to get information about various bars in the Vancouver area, and the foursquare API to discover popular places I had not heard of, also in the Vancouver area.

Tools used:
* Python
* SQL
* Pandas

## Project III - Unsupervised Learning
This project's purpose was to make use of unsupervised learning to get insights on customers banking behavior. It was a collaborative project, and for my part, I took a look at customer demographic data and tried to find hidden patterns. My partner looked at banking behavior, and together we aimed to associate certain demographics to spending behaviors using clusters.

Tools used:
* Python
* Scitkit-learn (KMeans, PCA)
* Matplotlib
* Pandas
